The following is a "choose your own adventure" game called "Paths of Life".

You name your own character. This is a one player game because it is more complex than a normal two player game. This game was designed from the point of view of one singular subjectivity. In this game, you must consider the notion of free will and whether or not the paths you choose are based on both knowledge and wisdom.

There are four parts to the game, each part with different decision (see wireframe images). Either you progress or you are eliminated at every turn. If you choose the path that is best for you, you will progress through that world and be faced with a series of decisions that you will have to make which will be either true or false, depending on your reality. If you make too many "false" decisions in a row, you will die.

Please see wireframes to view all 4 parts.
