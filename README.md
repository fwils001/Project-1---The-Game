Welcome!

The following is a "choose your own adventure" game called "Paths of Life".

You name your own character. This is a one player game, so it was designed from the point of view of one singular subjectivity. In this game, you must consider the notion of free will and whether or not the paths you choose are based on both knowledge and wisdom. Each time that you make a wise choice you get a wisdom point. 

There are four parts to the game, each part with different decision. Either you progress or you are eliminated at every turn. If you choose the path that is best for you, you will progress through that world and be faced with a series of decisions that you will have to make which will be either true or false, depending on your reality. If you make any "false" decisions, you will die. Pay attention to the "words of wisdom" on the start page. These are the hints that will guide you throughout the game.

Please see wireframes below to view all 4 parts:

User Stories

As a player, I want to use my own mental resources to make objective decisions in life because this will give me a sense of pride.

As a player, I want to be sure that every decision I make is based on correct intuition--give my knowledge at that time--so that I feel a sense of control.

As a player, I want to be able to spot reg flags from a mile away so that I can feel a sense of agency.

___________________________________

My MVP goals were to: create a logical story tree that could be replicated programmatically, provide multiple background images and animations, and to give the player wisdom points for correct choices.

My stretch goal was to avoid using too many "alerts" or "prompts" as they are annoying to the user. I achieved this goal as well.

Enjoy Paths of Life! I hope that you will learn something new about yourself.
