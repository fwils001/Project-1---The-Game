    <div id="mt-doom-question">Well here you are at Mt. Doom. Is this what you imagined? Looks pretty steep and dangerous to me! Would you like to scale it yourself or take a guide? Remember the words of wisdom.</div>
    
    <div id="mt-doom-frozen">You walk along the windy peaks with your jacket wrapped tight around you and your hat pulled down low over your ears. Suddenly, you turn around and realize that the path is gone. You must have diverged somwehere! Now totally lost, you check your cell phone for reception. Nothing. It's getting dark. You shiver and curl up next to a boulder. By the next morning, you have frozen to death. Next time, remember to ask for help when you need it! GAME OVER!</div>
    
    <div id="jungle-question">You have entered the Jungle of Death. Looks a bit menacing...far more than I would have ever imagined! You are now faced with two options: face the beasts alone on foot or hop in a rental jeep. Remember the words of wisdom.</div>

    <div id="mt-doom-guide">As you are scaling the dizzying heights, you realize that you haven't heard your tour guide's voice in a while. As you turn around in fear, you notice a large brown animal off in the distance. It's a bear! In horror, you notice shreds of clothing entangled in his claws. Looks like your tour guide didn't make it. Horrified but motivated, you descend the mountain on your own and find the lodge. After mourning your fellow traveller's loss, you relax next to a fire with some hot cocoa. Congratulations! You may now proceed to Part 2.</div>

    <div id="tiger-outcome">It looks like you are making good progress. Your compass seems to be leading you in the right direction. You hear some leaves rustling behind you. When you turn around, you realize that you are surrounded on all sides by a pack of tigers! They hiss at you and tear you to shreds. I'm sorry it had to end this way. Remember, it is best to ask for help when you need it! GAME OVER!</div>

    <div id="monkeys-outcome">As you drive through the lush green plants and tall trees, you realize that you have been going in circles for hours. What will you do? Suddenly, your jeep is surrounded by a pack of friendly monkeys. They holler at you and motion with their pointy fingers. They are showing you the way back to boot camp. Congratulations! You may now proceed to Part 2.</div>
    
    <div id="sea-question">Ahoy there matey! Looks like there is a nasty storm brewing. Would you prefer to set sail in a luxury yacht or try your luck in a small fishing boat?</div>

    <div id="yacht-outcome">You watch as the outline of the shore slowly disappears into the horizon. Suddenly, large waves overtake you and your yacht capsizes. As you float around in your life jacket, you notice something swimming underneath you. Oh no! Sharks! Chomp chomp. You're dead. You should have been more humble. No one should take a yacht out onto the rough sea. GAME OVER!</div>

    <div id="fishing-outcome">As you are floating along, the sky clears and you decide to go fishing. After a few hours, you manage to catch a few big, juicy see bass. Delicious! You feast on them upon your return to shore. Congratulations! You made it to Part 3. Take a bow.</div>
